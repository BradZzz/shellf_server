He does, of course, but that's not the whole explanation: A lot of the things he writes about -- exploding Pop-Tarts, for example -- are real. In fact, Dave's main job as a humor columnist -- aside from playing Stealth Fighter on his computer to avoid writing humor columns -- is to point out what is already funny in a world that is seriously bonkers. In Dave's world, amazing but true adventures occur every day, as the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist investigates a ground-breaking anti-flatulence product recommended to him by a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court; the ecologically dangerous shellfish attacking women's undergarments; and the epidemic of snakes and woodland creatures currently appearing in people's toilets. Dave's bad song contest required him to read thousands of entries from people like you; now, people like you could have the pleasure of being badgered all the bad songs that badger Dave. Dave also participates in real-life form of investigative journalism that actually require him to leave the house: marching with the Lawn Rangers precision lawnmower drill team of Arcola, Illinois; playing lead guitar in an extremely mediocre rock band with Stephen King and other literary lights; and taking his little boat Buster from its happy berth in the Barry garage onto Miami's high seas, only to run it aground. He's even appeared in an episode of \"Dave's World,\" the CBS television show based on his real life -- only taller -- in which he bids for an air conditioner. Dave Barry Is Not Making This Up includes longer feature pieces by Dave in which many of the featured facts happen to be accurate. Now you can read Dave Barry on UFO thrillseekers and the Elvis lovers who hang out at Graceland -- all articles that show Dave at his best and smartest. Complete with illustrations by Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Jeff MacNelly, Dave Barry is Not Making This Up brings you straight into the truly twisted center of Dave's world. On Buying His Son Sneakers: The salesperson's tone of voice carried the clear implication that he was going to call the Child Abuse Hotline if I didn't care enough, as a parent, to take out a second mortgage so I could purchase sufficient sneakerage for my son.... We need Congress to pass a law requiring the sneaker industry to return to the system we had when I was growing up, under which there was only one kind of sneakers, namely U.S. Keds, which were made from Army surplus tents and which cost about $10, or roughly $1 per pound. On Being Left-Handed: According to the researchers, left-handers die sooner than right-handers because they have more accidents. I know why this is: We read books backward...This saves us a lot of time with murder mysteries, but it's a bad habit when we're reading, say, the instructions for operating a barbecue grill, and we begin with \"Step 147: Ignite Gas.\" On The Uses Of Exploding Pop-Tarts: When we detected incoming missiles, we'd simply hold the toaster levers down via some method (possibly involving Tom and Roseanne Arnold) and within a few minutes Whoom the country would be surrounded by a protective wall of flames, and the missiles would either burn up or get knocked off course and detonate harmlessly in some place like New Jersey.

In that time, Dan Robie -- a local attorney and pillar of the community -- has been elected town judge. Despite this, most of Cantrell is aligned against Dan. His guilt is assumed. To make matters worse, Dan has refused to do anything to defend himself. When Robie tries to help, his father responds only with anger and defiance. Could Dan really be guilty? With the equally formidable Jessica Reel at his side, Robie ignores his father's wishes and begins his own desperate investigation into the case. But Robie is now a stranger to his hometown, an outsider, a man who has forsaken his past and his family. His attempts to save his father are met with distrust and skepticism ... and violence. Unlike the missions Robie undertook in the service of his country, where his target was clearly defined, digging into his father's case only reveals more questions. Robie is drawn into the hidden underside of Cantrell, where he must face the unexpected and possibly deadly consequences of the long-ago choices made by father and son.

Moldea, for decades the National Football League has had a strong and unspoken understanding with a dangerous institution: organized crime. In his classic expos\u00e9, Interference, Moldea bares the dark, sordid underbelly of America\u2019s favorite professional team sport, revealing a nest of corruption that the league has largely ignored since its inception. Based on intensive research and in-depth interviews with coaches, players, mobsters, bookies, gamblers, referees, and league officials\u2014including some of the sport\u2019s all-time greats\u2014the author\u2019s shocking allegations suggest that the betting line is firmly in the hands of the mob, who occasionally manipulate the on-field action for maximum profit. Interference chronicles a long-standing history of gambling, drugs, and extortion, of point-shaving and game-fixing, and reveals the eye-opening truth about numerous gridiron contests where the final results were determined even before the kickoff. Moldea exposes the mob connections of many of the team owners and their startling complicity in illegal gambling operations, while showing how NFL internal security has managed to quash nearly every investigation into illegality and corruption within the professional football world before it could get off the ground. Provocative, disturbing, and controversial, Interference is a must-read for football fans and detractors alike, offering indisputable proof that what\u2019s really happening on the field, in the locker room, and behind the scenes is a whole different ball game.", "publishedDate": "2014-06-10", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In his classic expos\u00e9, Interference, Moldea bares the dark, sordid underbelly of America\u2019s favorite professional team sport, revealing a nest of corruption that the league has largely ignored since its inception."}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=YHadAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dan+E+Moldea,+Interference-+How+Organized+Crime+Influences+Professional+Football&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "pageCount": 509, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YHadAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YHadAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Dan E.

When Jake Runyon agrees to investigate, it seems a relatively simple matter to expose the extortionist by setting a trap for him. The case, however, is nowhere near as clear-cut as it first appears. And Verity Daniels is nowhere near the helpless victim she pretends to be. A series of surprise revelations culminates in Runyon being falsely accused of a crime that never happened, and he and his employers then become the targets of a vicious legal vendetta. A sudden act of violence turns the case upside down, leading to a much more serious charge against Jake. With the help of partner Tamara Corbin, Nameless (known as Bill to his associates) puts aside the difficult personal issue that has kept him sidelined at home and works to clear both Runyon's and the agency's good names. The task requires untangling Verity Daniels's bizarre past and present relationships, and before Bill succeeds, he must overcome a deadly threat to his own safety.

Americans have built an empire on the idea of \u201crace,\u201d a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men\u2014bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden? Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son\u2014and readers\u2014the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children\u2019s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.

Sloan of the Calleshire CID is used to the occasional oddity in his relatively quiet part of the English countryside. But lately things have taken a strange turn. First, in the center of a yew maze that is the showpiece of the Tudor-era house, Aumerle Court, a body is spotted by Miss Daphne Pedlinge, the elderly chatelaine of the Court. By the time the groundskeeper actually makes it to the center, he, too, spies the body, and it is indeed dead. Meanwhile, a few miles away, a slaughtered rabbit is left on the Bishop's doorstep in nearby Calleford, an omen as portentous as the body in the maze.

The world of Jim Jones was one of inverted ideals, isolation and alienation. However, what began as a church that appealed to peoples inner spirit to help others, was turned into a living hell. Yet it was a place she would go, half a continent away, to be with her 2 year old son, who'd been taken to Jonestown by Jim Jones as he made his exodus to Guyana. It shares the horrors of Jonestown - the labor punishment squads, suicide drills, sleep deprivation, drugging, and humiliations. It also takes the reader through the escape that she says was revealed to her in the spirit. Thirty years since Jonestown, Slavery of Faith also chronicles her return to the U.S. under a veil of secrecy in fear of the \"death squads,\" her fight to maintain her faith in her most darkest hours; suffering survivors guilt, drug addiction, a family suicide, and finally redemption. It shares her journey through psychological and spiritual jungles to reach a place of remembrance-- to \"live their love and not their deaths.\" Faith has allowed her the resiliency to as she states \"tuck and roll\" and discover that through pain, tragedy and joy, her life has found divine order.", "title": "Slavery of Faith", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=L8fMF_nh4TwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Lesley+Jones,+Carnage+-+The+Story+of+U&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Slavery Of Faith...the quietly kept story of a young woman&#39;s escape through the jungles of Jonestown, Guyana the morning of the massacre November 18, 1978 and her struggles to live in the aftermath."}, "publishedDate": "2009-01", "pageCount": 220, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L8fMF_nh4TwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L8fMF_nh4TwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Leslie Wagner-Wilson"], "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=L8fMF_nh4TwC&dq=Lesley+Jones,+Carnage+-+The+Story+of+U&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"]}, "name": "Lesley Jones, Carnage - The Story of U"}, "256": {"google": {"subtitle": "And 131 More Warped Suggestions and Well-Intended Rants", "description": "In celebration of the 10th anniversary of the landmark book Freakonomics comes this curated collection from the most readable economics blog in the universe. It\u2019s the perfect solution for the millions of readers who love all things Freakonomics. Surprising and erudite, eloquent and witty, When to Rob a Bank demonstrates the brilliance that has made the Freakonomics guys an international sensation, with more than 7 million books sold in 40 languages, and 150 million downloads of their Freakonomics Radio podcast. When Freakonomics was first published, the authors started a blog\u2014and they\u2019ve kept it up. The writing is more casual, more personal, even more outlandish than in their books. In When to Rob a Bank, they ask a host of typically off-center questions: Why don\u2019t flight attendants get tipped? If you were a terrorist, how would you attack? And why does KFC always run out of fried chicken? Over the past decade, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner have published more than 8,000 blog posts on Freakonomics.com. Many of them, they freely admit, were rubbish. But now they\u2019ve gone through and picked the best of the best. You\u2019ll discover what people lie about, and why; the best way to cut gun deaths; why it might be time for a sex tax; and, yes, when to rob a bank. (Short answer: never; the ROI is terrible.)

People, 806 III. 306 (1883) Dr. Kay Scarpetta is working a suspicious death scene in Cambridge, Massachusetts when an emergency alert sounds on her phone. A video link lands in her text messages and seems to be from her computer genius niece Lucy. But how can it be? It\u2019s clearly a surveillance film of Lucy taken almost twenty years ago. As Scarpetta watches she begins to learn frightening secrets about her niece, whom she has loved and raised like a daughter. That film clip and then others sent soon after raise dangerous legal implications that increasingly isolate Scarpetta and leave her confused, worried, and not knowing where to turn. She doesn\u2019t know whom she can tell\u2014not her FBI husband Benton Wesley or her investigative partner Pete Marino. Not even Lucy. In this new novel, Cornwell launches these unforgettable characters on an intensely psychological odyssey that includes the mysterious death of a Hollywood mogul\u2019s daughter, aircraft wreckage on the bottom of the sea in the Bermuda Triangle, a grisly gift left in the back of a crime scene truck, and videos from the past that threaten to destroy Scarpetta\u2019s entire world and everyone she loves.

As the Soviets consolidated power in Eastern Europe, the CIA scrambled to gain the upper hand against new enemies worldwide. To this end, senior officials at the CIA, National Security Council, and other elements of the emerging US national security state turned to thousands of former Nazis, Waffen Secret Service, and Nazi collaborators for propaganda, psychological warfare, and military operations. Many new recruits were clearly responsible for the deaths of countless innocents as part of Adolph Hitler\u2019s \u201cFinal Solution,\u201d yet were whitewashed and claimed to be valuable intelligence assets.

Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow presents a landmark biography of Alexander Hamilton, the Founding Father who galvanized, inspired, scandalized, and shaped the newborn nation. In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades, Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the newborn America. According to historian Joseph Ellis, Alexander Hamilton is \u201ca robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.\u201d Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow\u2019s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today\u2019s America is the result of Hamilton\u2019s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. \u201cTo repudiate his legacy,\u201d Chernow writes, \u201cis, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.\u201d Chernow here recounts Hamilton\u2019s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington\u2019s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America\u2019s birth as the triumph of Jefferson\u2019s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we\u2019ve encountered before\u2014from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton\u2019s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804. Chernow\u2019s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America\u2019s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots, Alexander Hamilton will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans. \u201cNobody has captured Hamilton better than Chernow\u201d \u2014The New York Times Book Review From the Trade Paperback edition.", "title": "Alexander Hamilton", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=4z5eL5SGjEoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Ron+Chernow,+Alexander+Hamilton&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades, Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the newborn America."}, "publishedDate": "2005-03-29", "pageCount": 832, "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4z5eL5SGjEoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4z5eL5SGjEoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Ron Chernow"], "ratingsCount": 13, "infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4z5eL5SGjEoC&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "averageRating": 4.0}, "name": "Ron Chernow, Alexander Hamilton"}, "242": {"google": {"description": "\u201cRon Carlson\u2019s novel is in the coming-of-age tradition, with the contemporary attributes of humor and cool. . . .

When someone murders Cece Swann, Eja and Deming become the most uncommon team of sleuths in ye olde bean towne. Cece had everything--looks, brains, and money galore. Her love of life was legendary, as was her rampant fear of heights. Leaping off a building was the last thing she would ever do. When she dies that way, Eja and Deming know it was neither suicide nor an accident. Partnering to catch her killer plunges the pair into a major relationship shift. Gone is the exasperating big-brother figure from Eja's girlhood; now she's confronted with an irritating, irresistible grown man. Eja isn't gorgeous, blue-blooded, or glamorous; she's battling a few extra pounds and a set of lowered expectations about life in general and men in particular. But when it comes to loyalty and courage, she's as tough as a junkyard dog and twice as likely to bite. Can she resist taking a chunk out of her arrogant partner during the search for CeCe's killer? Deming's film star looks and sense of entitlement drive her crazy. Now, however, the rules between them change as they unravel the trail of a ruthless murderer.

It is one of 54 remote frontier worlds forced to pay tribute to the corrupt Constellation, which is ruled by decadent nobles. An exiled rebel general, Tiber Adolphus, has now mounted a second rebellion against the Constellation, much larger than his earlier failed attempt. This time Adolphus aligns himself with the Xayans, a resurrected alien race from Hellhole. As the ancient civilization awakens, the Xayans encourage colonists to immerse themselves in strange \"slickwater\" pools and acquire ancient alien memories. Their goal is to gather sufficient numbers to achieve ala'ru, an accelerated evolution that will transform them into godlike beings. General Adolphus rallies his fellow rebels from across the vast Deep Zone to fight for their independence, while the ruthless leader of the Constellation, Diadem Michella, vows to eradicate the rebellion and all colonists on Hellhole. The Xayans add their \"telemancy\" defenses to the General's conventional military resources, until they reveal an enemy far more terrifying than the Army of the Constellation: a faction of rogue Xayans bent on the extermination of their race . . . and the destruction of any planet that happens to be in the way. As a barrage of deadly asteroids hurtles toward Hellhole, and the Constellation's gigantic space fleet arrives for a final engagement against General Adolphus, the hardy settlers are caught between a human enemy that wants to raze their colony to the ground and much more powerful aliens who can destroy not only themselves, but human civilization, as well as the foundations of the universe itself.

Peter Stark offers a harrowing saga in which a band of explorers battled nature, starvation, and madness to establish the first American settlement in the Pacific Northwest and opened up what would become the Oregon trail, permanently altering the nation's landscape and its global standing. Six years after Lewis and Clark's began their journey to the Pacific Northwest, two of the Eastern establishment's leading figures, John Jacob Astor and Thomas Jefferson, turned their sights to founding a colony akin to Jamestown on the West Coast and transforming the nation into a Pacific trading power. Author and correspondent for Outside magazine Peter Stark recreates this pivotal moment in American history for the first time for modern readers, drawing on original source material to tell the amazing true story of the Astor Expedition. Unfolding over the course of three years, from 1810 to 1813, Astoria is a tale of high adventure and incredible hardship in the wilderness and at sea. Of the more than one hundred-forty members of the two advance parties that reached the West Coast\u2014one crossing the Rockies, the other rounding Cape Horn\u2014nearly half perished by violence. Others went mad. Within one year, the expedition successfully established Fort Astoria, a trading post on the Columbia River. Though the colony would be short-lived, it opened provincial American eyes to the potential of the Western coast and its founders helped blaze the Oregon Trail.", "publishedDate": "2014-03-04", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Thus began one of history&#39;s dramatic but largely forgotten turning points in the conquest of the North American continent.

We expect our judges to be honest and wise. Their integrity and impartiality are the bedrock of the entire judicial system. We trust them to ensure fair trials, to protect the rights of all litigants, to punish those who do wrong, and to oversee the orderly and efficient flow of justice. But what happens when a judge bends the law or takes a bribe? It\u2019s rare, but it happens. Lacy Stoltz is an investigator for the Florida Board on Judicial Conduct. She is a lawyer, not a cop, and it is her job to respond to complaints dealing with judicial misconduct. After nine years with the Board, she knows that most problems are caused by incompetence, not corruption. But a corruption case eventually crosses her desk. A previously disbarred lawyer is back in business with a new identity. He now goes by the name Greg Myers, and he claims to know of a Florida judge who has stolen more money than all other crooked judges combined. And not just crooked judges in Florida. All judges, from all states, and throughout U.S. history. What\u2019s the source of the ill-gotten gains? It seems the judge was secretly involved with the construction of a large casino on Native American land. The Coast Mafia financed the casino and is now helping itself to a sizable skim of each month\u2019s cash. The judge is getting a cut and looking the other way. It\u2019s a sweet deal: Everyone is making money. But now Greg wants to put a stop to it. His only client is a person who knows the truth and wants to blow the whistle and collect millions under Florida law. Greg files a complaint with the Board on Judicial Conduct, and the case is assigned to Lacy Stoltz, who immediately suspects that this one could be dangerous. Dangerous is one thing.

That willingness to speak her mind, stand her ground, and rattle the occasional cage has enabled this tough-talking girl from Brooklyn to forge an enduring and successful career in Hollywood. But being a troublemaker has come at a cost. That was never more evident than in 2013, when Remini loudly and publicly broke with the Church of Scientology. Now, in this frank, funny, poignant memoir, the former King of Queens star opens up about that experience for the first time, revealing the in-depth details of her painful split with the church and its controversial practices. Indoctrinated into the church as a child while living with her mother and sister in New York, Remini eventually moved to Los Angeles, where her dreams of becoming an actress and advancing Scientology\u2019s causes grew increasingly intertwined. As an adult, she found the success she\u2019d worked so hard for, and with it a prominent place in the hierarchy of celebrity Scientologists alongside people such as Tom Cruise, Scientology\u2019s most high-profile adherent. Remini spent time directly with Cruise and was included among the guests at his 2006 wedding to Katie Holmes. But when she began to raise questions about some of the church\u2019s actions, she found herself a target. In the end, she was declared by the church to be a threat to their organization and therefore a \u201cSuppressive Person,\u201d and as a result, all of her fellow parishioners\u2014including members of her own family\u2014were told to disconnect from her.

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE WASHINGTON POST \u2022 THE NEW YORK TIMES \u2022 NPR BOOKS FOR A BETTER LIFE AWARD FINALIST At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade\u2019s worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi\u2019s transformation from a na\u00efve medical student \u201cpossessed,\u201d as he wrote, \u201cby the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life\u201d into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. \u201cI began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSeven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: \u2018I can\u2019t go on. I\u2019ll go on.\u2019\u201d When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both. Praise for When Breath Becomes Air \u201cI guarantee that finishing this book and then forgetting about it is simply not an option. . . . Part of this book\u2019s tremendous impact comes from the obvious fact that its author was such a brilliant polymath.

The victims: a talented young skater, a doctor, and a teacher. As random as random can be. Eve Dallas has seen a lot of killers during her time with the NYPSD but never one like this. A review of the security videos reveals that the victims were killed with a tactical laser rifle fired by a sniper, who could have been miles away when the trigger was pulled. And though the list of locations where the shooter could have set up seems endless, the number of people with that particular skill set is finite: police, military, professional killer. Eve's husband, Roarke, has unlimited resources--and genius--at his disposal. And when his computer program leads Eve to the location of the sniper, she learns a shocking fact: There were two--one older, one younger. Someone is being trained by an expert in the science of killing, and they have an agenda. Central Park was just a warm-up.

The decline of this group, a demographic of our country that has been slowly disintegrating over forty years, has been reported on with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck. The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.\u2019s grandparents were \u201cdirt poor and in love,\u201d and moved north from Kentucky\u2019s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually their grandchild (the author) would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of their success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that this is only the short, superficial version. Vance\u2019s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother, struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, and were never able to fully escape the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. Vance piercingly shows how he himself still carries around the demons of their chaotic family history. A deeply moving memoir with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.", "publishedDate": "2016-06-28", "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "J.

Once, the Seven Shapers dwelled in accord. First-born among them was Haomane, Lord-of-Thought and with his brother and sister gods, the Seven drew upon of the power of the Souma, claimed a race of beings for their own and began Shaping the world to their will. But Haomane saw the ways of this new world and was displeased. For in his younger brother Satoris, once called the Sower, Haomane thought too prideful and in his gift, the quickening of the flesh too freely to the races...and to that of Man in particular. Haomane asked Satoris to withdraw his Gift from Men but he refused. And so began the Shapers' War. Eons have passed. The war that ensued Sundered the very world. Haomane and his siblings lay to one end of a vast ocean unable to touch their creations, Satoris and the races of the world on the other. Satoris has been broken and left adrift among the peoples of the world and is reviled, with most of the races believing that it was he alone who caused the rift and depriving them of the balm of the Seven. He sits in Darkhaven, controlling his own dominion--seeking not victory but neither vengeance. But still Haomane is not content. Through Haomane's whispers in the minds and hearts of the races of the world come a prophecy that if Satoris were defeated, the world could be made whole and all would bask in the light of the Souma again. And the few who stay by Satoris are viewed as the ultimate evil. And so the races come together to defeat Satoris, a being who helped engender them all but who is caught in his elder brother's warp.

Her prose is as intensely realistic and compelling as ever in The Man of My Dreams, a disarmingly candid and sympathetic novel about the collision of a young woman\u2019s fantasies of family and love with the challenges and realities of adult life. Hannah Gavener is fourteen in the summer of 1991. In the magazines she reads, celebrities plan elaborate weddings; in Hannah\u2019s own life, her parents\u2019 marriage is crumbling. And somewhere in between these two extremes\u2013just maybe\u2013lie the answers to love\u2019s most bewildering questions.

Is settling for someone who\u2019s not your soul mate an act of maturity or an admission of defeat? And if you move to another state for a guy who might not love you back, are you being plucky\u2013or just pathetic? None of the relationships in Hannah\u2019s life are without complications. There\u2019s her father, whose stubbornness Hannah realizes she\u2019s unfortunately inherited; her gorgeous cousin, Fig, whose misbehavior alternately intrigues and irritates Hannah; Henry, whom Hannah first falls for in college, while he\u2019s dating Fig; and the boyfriends who love her more or less than she deserves, who adore her or break her heart. By the time she\u2019s in her late twenties, Hannah has finally figured out what she wants most\u2013but she doesn\u2019t yet know whether she\u2019ll find the courage to go after it.

The story of Welles Crowther, whose actions on 9/11 offer a lasting lesson on character, calling and courage One Sunday morning before church, when Welles Crowther was a young boy, his father gave him a red handkerchief for his back pocket. Welles kept it with him that day, and just about every day to come; it became a fixture and his signature. A standout athlete growing up in Upper Nyack, NY, Welles was also a volunteer at the local fire department, along with his father. He cherished the necessity and the camaraderie, the meaning of the role. Fresh from college, he took a Wall Street job on the 104th floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center, but the dream of becoming a firefighter with the FDNY remained. When the Twin Towers fell, Welles\u2019s parents had no idea what happened to him. In the unbearable days that followed, they came to accept that he would never come home. But the mystery of his final hours persisted. Eight months after the attacks, however, Welles\u2019s mother read a news account from several survivors, badly hurt on the 78th floor of the South Tower, who said they and others had been led to safety by a stranger, carrying a woman on his back, down nearly twenty flights of stairs. After leading them down, the young man turned around. \u201cI\u2019m going back up,\u201d was all he said. The survivors didn\u2019t know his name, but despite the smoke and panic, one of them remembered a single detail clearly: the man was wearing a red bandanna. Tom Rinaldi\u2019s The Red Bandanna is about a fearless choice, about a crucible of terror and the indomitable spirit to answer it. Examining one decision in the gravest situation, it celebrates the difference one life can make.
