author Dave Barry. We never know what will happen next in Florida. We know only that, any minute now, something will. Every few months, Dave Barry gets a call from some media person wanting to know, \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with Florida?\u201d Somehow, the state\u2019s acquired an image as a subtropical festival of stupid, and as a loyal Floridian, Dave begs to differ. Sure, there was the 2000 election. And people seem to take their pants off for no good reason. And it has flying insects the size of LeBron James. But it is a great state, and Dave is going to tell you why. Join him as he celebrates Florida from Key West at the bottom to whatever it is that\u2019s at the top, from the Sunshine State\u2019s earliest history to the fun-fair of weirdness that it is today. It\u2019s the most hilarious book yet from \u201cthe funniest damn writer in the whole country\u201d (Carl Hiaasen, and he should know). By the end, you\u2019ll have to admit that whatever else you might think about Florida\u2014you can never say it\u2019s boring.
